# 🛰️ Automated Agricultural Boundary Delineation
### High-Resolution Field Mapping via Sentinel-2 & Deep Learning

This project presents an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for automated agricultural field boundary delineation using Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery. The system enhances 10m resolution satellite imagery using a CNN-based super-resolution model and performs semantic segmentation to extract agricultural field boundaries. The final outputs are GIS-ready vector files suitable for spatial analysis applications.

## 🎯 Objectives
* **Enhance Resolution:** Upscale Sentinel-2 imagery from 10m to higher spatial resolution (3m / 1m).
* **Automated Detection:** Automatically detect agricultural field boundaries.
* **GIS Integration:** Generate raster and vector outputs for seamless GIS usage.
* **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using standard segmentation metrics.

---

## 📊 Input Data
* **Satellite Source:** Sentinel-2.
* **Format:** GeoTIFF.
* **Spatial Resolution:** 10 meters.
* **Bands Used:**
    * **Red (B4), Green (B3), Blue (B2):** Provide visual context.
    * **Near-Infrared (B8):** Improves vegetation discrimination and boundary detection accuracy.

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The pipeline consists of the following five stages:

1.  **Data Preprocessing:** Includes cloud masking, band stacking (RGB + NIR), normalization, and image tiling.
2.  **Super-Resolution:** A CNN-based model that enhances spatial resolution from 10m to 3m/1m.
3.  **Boundary Segmentation:** A U-Net based semantic segmentation model for pixel-wise agricultural boundary detection.
4.  **Post-processing:** Morphological filtering, noise removal, and connected component cleanup.
5.  **Vectorization:** Raster-to-polygon conversion and export to GeoJSON/Shapefile with CRS preservation.
